module: graphiant_device_system
short_description: Configure device name, region, and site (Edge or Core)
description:
  - >-
    Sets C(name), C(regionName), and C(site) on the C(edge) or C(core) object for
    C(PUT /v1/devices/{device_id}/config), matching
    U(https://github.com/Graphiant-Inc/graphiant-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/V1DevicesDeviceIdConfigPutRequest.md).
  - >-
    YAML and module options use the same keys as the API branch payload (except optional C(device_type),
    which selects the C(edge) vs C(core) branch and is not sent in the request body).
  - >-
    After C(GET /v1/devices/{id}), the module maps portal C(role) to the config branch
    (C(core) → C(core), C(cpe) → C(edge)) when C(device_type) is omitted. If C(device_type) is set,
    it must match that mapping.
  - >-
    Supply C(system_config_file) for a bulk C(device_system) list, and/or C(device) with
    C(name) / C(regionName) / C(site) to run a single device or to override one device from the file.
  - >-
    Only keys you set are merged onto current device state; omitted keys are left unchanged.
  - Validates portal site exists when C(site.name) is set.
  - >-
    Idempotent when the merged payload already matches the device. Current state is read from
    C(GET /v1/devices/{id}) using C(hostname) as C(name), C(regionOverride.name) when set else
    C(region.name) as C(regionName), and C(site.name) as C(site), aligned with the portal device object.
  - >-
    Omit C(site) entirely to leave the portal site unchanged. A YAML C(site) key with an empty
    value or without C(name) is treated as unspecified (not a request to clear site).
  - >-
    If a device has no site in the portal and your desired config also omits C(site), a config push
    is not attempted, because the API can reject the update. The module fails the task, and
    C(skipped_no_site) lists the affected hostnames. No other device in the same play is updated
    in that run (aborted) until you assign a site in the portal or set C(site) in YAML.
notes:
  - "Deconfigure is not supported; apply desired values with C(operation=configure)."
  - "Configuration files support Jinja2 templating syntax for dynamic value substitution."
  - >-
    With C(ansible-playbook --check), writes are skipped but C(changed) reflects whether an apply
    would update at least one device, unless a device fails the no-site rule, in which case the task
    fails and C(changed) is false. Use C(--diff) with check mode to preview branch changes when
    a run would succeed.

      - Relative paths resolve using the collection config path (see C(GRAPHIANT_CONFIGS_PATH)).

      - Selects the C(edge) or C(core) branch of C(PUT .../config). Not sent in the API body.
      - >-
        Optional. If omitted, the branch is taken from the device's portal C(role) on
        C(GET /v1/devices/{id}) (C(core) for core, C(cpe) for edge/CPE). If set, it must match
        that inferred branch.

attributes:
  check_mode:
    description: Supports check mode similarly to other device config modules.
    support: full
    details: >
      In check mode, no configuration is pushed; the module still reads current device state to
      determine whether changes would be made. C(changed) is C(true) when at least one device
      would be updated, unless a device hits the no-site error (task fails, C(changed) false). Payloads
      that would be pushed are logged with a C([check_mode]) prefix by the underlying client.
  diff_mode:
    description: Supports Ansible's C(--diff) for pending edge/core branch updates.
    support: full
    details: >
      When the playbook runs with C(--diff) and a device branch would change, the module returns
      a C(diff) dictionary (C(before) / C(after) strings). Structured entries are also in
      C(details.diff_plan).
