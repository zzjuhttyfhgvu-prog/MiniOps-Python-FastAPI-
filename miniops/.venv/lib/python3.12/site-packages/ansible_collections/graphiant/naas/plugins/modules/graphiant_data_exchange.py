short_description: Manage Graphiant Data Exchange services, customers, matches, and invitations
description:
  - This module provides comprehensive Data Exchange management capabilities for Graphiant's B2B peering platform.
  - Enables creating and deleting Data Exchange services and customers.
  - Provides service-to-customer matching operations with automatic match response file management.
  - Supports invitation acceptance with gateway service deployment and VPN configuration.
version_added: "25.11.0"
extends_documentation_fragment:
  - graphiant.naas.graphiant_portal_auth
notes:
  - "Data Exchange Workflows:"
  - "  - Workflow 1 (Create Services): Create Data Exchange services that can be shared with customers."
  - "  - Workflow 2 (Create Customers): Create Data Exchange customers (nonGraphiant peers)."
  - "  - Workflow 3 (Match Services): Match services to customers and establish peering relationships."
  - "  - Workflow 4 (Accept Invitation): Accept service invitations for non Graphiant customers."
  - "Configuration files support Jinja2 templating syntax for dynamic configuration generation."
  - "Match responses are automatically saved to JSON files in the output directory near the configuration file."
  - "The module automatically resolves names to IDs for sites, LAN segments, services, customers, and regions."
  - "All operations are idempotent and safe to run multiple times without creating duplicates."
  - "For accept_invitation operation, minimum 2 gateways per region are required for redundancy."
  - "Check mode (C(--check)) is supported. In check mode, the module runs all logic (config load, validation,"
  - "name-to-ID resolution) but the API client skips write operations and logs payloads with C([check_mode])."
  - "Use C(--check) to validate accept_invitation without making API calls."

  operation:
    description:
      - "The specific Data Exchange operation to perform."

      - "Services define peering services with LAN segments, sites, and service prefixes."
      - "Optional I(policy.globalObjectOps): keys are device names (resolved to device IDs) or device IDs;"
      - >-
        values can include I(routingPolicyOps) to attach Graphiant filters per device
        (e.g. I(Policy-DC1-Primary): I(Attach)).

        deleted before services they depend on.
      - "V(match_service_to_customers): Match services to customers from YAML configuration (Workflow 3)."
      - "Configuration file must contain I(data_exchange_matches) list with match definitions."
      - "Automatically saves match responses to JSON file for use in Workflow 4."
      - "Updates existing match entries or appends new ones based on customer_name and service_name."
      - "V(accept_invitation): Accept Data Exchange service invitation (Workflow 4)."
      - "Configuration file must contain I(data_exchange_acceptances) list with acceptance details."
      - "Requires O(matches_file) from Workflow 3 for match ID lookup."
      - "Supports dry-run mode for validation without API calls."
      - "Configures full IPSec gateway deployment with dual tunnels, static routing, and VPN profiles."
      - "For query operations (get_services_summary, get_customers_summary, get_service_health),"
